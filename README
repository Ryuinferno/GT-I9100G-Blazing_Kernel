A custom stock Samsung kernel for GT-I9100G. Only for devices running ICS TouchWiz ROMs. 

NOTE:
Files named "Delete before compiling" are only placeholder files, will be automatically removed when compiling, re-added after that.

COMPILING:
To build, cd to the kernel directory and use the "./build.sh" command; to clean the directories for a clean build, run "./build.sh clean"; to compile a kernel with CWM5 (default is CWM6), run "./build.sh old", "./build.sh touch" is for touch-based recovery. The ODIN flashable tar and zImage will be in a folder named "out".
